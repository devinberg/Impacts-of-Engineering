* Exam 3 20%

Grading of all homework and exams will be completed as quickly as possible. Graded assignments and exams will be returned as soon as grading is completed. It may not always be possible to review graded materials during lecture. Therefore, questions on graded materials should be handled during office hours. You can keep track of your performance in the course by monitoring your grades on D2L. If you notice any errors, please bring them to my attention as soon as possible.

Final Grades will be based on the following distribution:

≥93% A

90% - <93% A-

87% - <90% B+

83% - <87% B

80% - <83% B-

77% - <80% C+

73% - <77% C

70% - <73% C-

67% - <70% D+

63% - <67% D

60% - <63% D-

<60% F

**Homework:**

* Homework is due at the beginning of lecture.

* Homework will not be accepted for credit after the due date.

* Collaboration between different students on general solution methodologies is encouraged; however, assignments which appear to be copied will not be accepted for credit.

* Homework should be easy to read with good formatting practices.

* Homework is submitted one of two ways: (1) they are submitted in paper form at the beginning of class or (2) they are submitted electronically.

* Regrade requests must be submitted with a one-paragraph explanation of the request within one week from the date that the graded work is returned.

* Homework must be your own original work.

**Research Paper:**

* You will write a research paper as part of this class.

* Your paper must be written by yourself and be free of plagiarism.

* You will also review the papers written by your classmates and provide constructive feedback to help them improve.

* You will revise your paper based upon the feedback received from your classmates and will submit a final, polished paper by the due date. This paper will be published online using a journal authoring system.

**Project:**

* A course project will be included as part of this class.

* Each student will participate in the course project as a part of a small group.

* Each project group will be assigned a project grade that will be shared amongst the group members. Individual project grades may be adjusted up or down from the group grade based on individual contributions at the discretion of the instructor.

* Completion of the course project will require collaborative group work outside of class time. Please plan accordingly.

Final Project Presentation: TBA

**Semester Exams:** Make–up exams will only be given for medical or unavoidable personal reasons. A letter from a doctor/health center official is necessary if your absence is due to medical reasons. Although the schedule is subject to change, the semester exams are tentatively scheduled as shown in the semester agenda.

**A Few Ground Rules:**

* Attendance will not be graded. However, students are expected and encouraged to attend all class sessions. It is not possible to make up any Activities or other in-class work missed due to absence from class. Students are responsible for obtaining any missed material from their peers.

* Bring your textbook and calculator to class every day for in-class activities. Laptops will also be necessary most days.

* If you wish to meet with me, please schedule an appointment with me via email.

* Classroom demeanor is expected to be respectful of others and the class as a whole. This includes arriving to class on time and avoiding distracting activities. Please refrain from using cell phones, iPhones, iPods, and other similar items during class. Any other distractions such as reading the newspaper will not be permitted.

* Laptops are welcome for use in note-taking and course-related activities. However, if they become a distraction during the class period to you or your fellow classmates, you will be asked to store your laptop away. You are expected to store your laptop if requested by the instructor.

* The use of any tobacco or tobacco related products in class is strictly prohibited. This includes but is not limited to cigarettes, chewing tobacco, and e-cigarettes.

* If you require an accommodation for a disability, please contact the Campus Disability Services (206 Bowman Hall, 232-2995, www.uwstout.edu/disability) in a timely manner to assure that appropriate support and accommodations will be provided. Appropriate documentation of your disability and request of accommodations must be provided to be eligible for services.

* For any other issues not covered here, please refer to Chapter 14 of the UW System code.

** This document is subject to change as issues arise during the semester. Students will be notified of any changes as they become necessary.
